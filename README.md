# Python test â€” Alert Processing Service

Your task is to write a [Python](https://www.python.org) HTTP service that receives alerts and processes them.
When an alert is received, the service must:

- Extract resolution (width, height) from the video
- Send a notification to the user

The alert contains the following fields:

- `uid`: A unique ID generated by the on-premises device
- `video`: URI of a video segment that the alert is for (relative to our video server root)
- `timestamp`: POSIX timestamp for this video segment
- `store`: A unique string representing our client

Here is an example of the alert data:

```json
{
    "uid": "E00E9901-9246-4869-945A-7A0AABE1C382",
    "video": "/videos/test_1.avi",
    "timestamp": 1748871320.6882,
    "store": "test-store",
}
```

For the purpose of this exercise, to simulate sending the notification,
print the following information on the system console standard output:

- The store
- The date & time
- The video resolution (`[width]x[height]`).

You are free to use any tools, libraries, or frameworks you like.
Optionally, you can use the provided Docker containers to run PostgreSQL and the video server.

## Optional dockers

You can install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to run the environment:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

It provides two servers for you to use:

- A PostgreSQL database running on `localhost:5432` to store the alerts
- An HTTP web server serving videos on `localhost:8080` to retrieve the videos

Try accessing [http://localhost:8080/videos/](http://localhost:8080/videos/) for example.

**These dockers are provided for your convenience, you are not required to use them.**

## Scoring criteria & Interview preparation

Your answer will be reviewed and tested by the interview team before the technical interview.
The following criteria will be used to grade your answer:

- Documentation
- Compliance with usual standards, readability, and extensibility
- Correctness
- Robustness, error and edge cases management
- Performance & Scalability

To prepare for the interview, consider the possible improvements in terms of reliability and scalability.
Feel free to prepare support schematics in advance if you like.
